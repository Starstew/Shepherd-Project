# Definitions for spam filtering.
# Each line specifies a filter for items which are considered "definite spam".
# A plain text filter entry acts as a case-insensitive substring search.
# A regular-expression filter (/ delimited) entry acts as a full-text match.
# For example, an entry "foo" will match any of { "foo", "HelloFOo World!", "LOVELY FOOD" }.
# An entry "/[Bb]ar.*/" will match any of { "bar", "Barton Fink", "barrister" }, but not { "BAR", "abar" }.
