Hello! 

Thank you for submitting your polar bear photos. We will use this information to assist scientific research and global conservation initiatives. 

The photos and information that you have submitted has been encapsulated in an "encounter" that we track.  Each encounter is assigned a unique number, and you can view that encounter at any time using the link below or by going to our online library.

We will keep you informed of any changes to your submitted encounter, and email you if this polar bear is matched to another within the library.  We will also let you know if/when and where your animal is resighted by other community members.
