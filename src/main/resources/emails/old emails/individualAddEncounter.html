    <p>Just a quick email to let you know that the whale shark encounter that
      you submitted has been <span class="bold">matched</span> to a shark
      in the Wildbook for Whale Sharks photo-identification library.<br>
      Follow these links to find out more:</p>
    <p>Previously identified record: @INDIVIDUAL_ID@ (Alternate ID:
      @INDIVIDUAL_ALT_ID@)<br>
      <a href="@INDIVIDUAL_LINK@">@INDIVIDUAL_LINK@</a></p>
    <p>New encounter: @ENCOUNTER_ID@<br>
      <a href="@ENCOUNTER_LINK@">@ENCOUNTER_LINK@</a></p>
    <p>Thanks again for your critical help! If you're interested in supporting
